# Classification of human organs by ultrasound images

Repository for First Year Project in HSE Master's Programme _"Machine Learning and Data-Intensive Systems"_. 

__The Main goal__ of the Project is to create a Deep Learning model capable of classifiyng ultrasound images of patients for future usage in Medicine.

As of now, the Project has not yet started because of the need for Data Mining. 
Files present in the current Repository represent a hypothetical example of working with real-life Data from Medicine field.

Dataset used in the hypothetical example: [_Golovenkin, S.E.; Gorban, Alexander; Mirkes, Evgeny; Shulman, V.A.; Rossiev, D.A.; Shesternya, P.A.; et al. (2020): Myocardial infarction complications Database. University of Leicester. Dataset.](https://doi.org/10.25392/leicester.data.12045261.v3)_
